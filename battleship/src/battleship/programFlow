Understand the strategy of the game: 
this is a solo version of the Battleship game where the computer places the ships, 
and the human attempts to sink them.


How to play:
Initially the ocean is empty.  
Then the computer places the ten ships on the ocean in such a way that no ships are 
immediately adjacent to each other, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The human player does not know where the ships are.

THE INITIAL DISPLAY OF THE OCEAN SHOWS A 10 X 10 ARRAY OF LOCATIONS, ALL THE SAME.
THE PLAYER TRIES TO HIT THE SHIPS, BY CALLING OUT A ROW AND COLUMN NUMBER.
THE COMPUTER RESPONDS WITH ONE BIT OF INFORMATION - HIT OR MISS.
THE PROGRAM DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE KIND OF SHIP IF IT IS HIT BUT NOT SUNK
WHEN A SHIP SINKS THE PROGRAM PRINTS OUT A MESSAGE: YOU JUST SANK A 'SHIP-TYPE'.


AFTER EACH SHOT THE COMPUTER REDISPAYS THE OCEAN WITH THE NEW INFORMATION.
A SHIP IS SUNK WHEN EVERY SQUARE OF THE SHIP HAS BEEN HIT.
